  <h1>A TRIP TO ENGLAND</h1>

<p>In my recent visit to <strong><em>England</em></strong>, I visited a few cities and had so much fun that i never expected. Firstly, I visited the city of <strong><em>Manchester</em></strong> where I met so many old friends who gave me a warm welcome and made me feel at home.

  Furthermore, I traveled to the city of <strong>London</strong> after spending 3 days in <strong>Manchester</strong> with my friends. <strong>London</strong> is so beautiful but over crowdy, on like <strong>Manchester</strong> with less population of people.

  After spending a week in <strong><em>England</em></strong>, I had the best time of my life but unfortunately I have to travel back to <strong><em>Africa</em></strong> where I belong. However, the trip was overall worthwhile and I will love to visit again</p>

<h2 id="overall">My Overall Experience In England</h2>
<p>My experience in England was really memorable, Proper English tea, red buses, black cabs, everything felt new. I wandered the British Museum for hours, completely absorbed. I visited a cozy pub and watched locals chat about football like it was religion. Lovely people and friendly culture. Worth every penny.</p>
